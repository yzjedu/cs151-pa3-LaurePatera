**Objective:**
I was supposed to create a program that would output ASCII art to the user, with various designs depending on the option that the user chose. I experimented with error checking, decision making, and functions. 

--------------
**Procedure:** After reading the entire read me file, the first thing I did was determine what high-level tasks would be needed to create the program, and then I began designing an algorithm, with these high-level tasks as my functions. From there, I coded each function separately so that I could individually test each one before moving on to the next. Lastly, I coded the main function and added all of the others together into one program. I tested this again with test cases including error checking, and made any small changes I needed to ensure that the program would work properly. The main concepts I explored were functions, and iterative development.

-------------------------
**Results:**
My results matched what I expected, after doing all of my testing and completing my program. I used many different test cases, including inputs that I accounted for in error checking to avoid bad user input.


------------------------
**Reflection:**
The main challenge I encountered was ensuring that the ASCII art would output correctly, with the right number of white space in between each symbol. I had to test my program with each design multiple times before I could make sure that each one looked right. As for following the 3 rules of programming, the first thing I did for this assignment was read the read me file and consider the problem closely. I design first, and coded afterwards. Then, I did a lot of testing to ensure that this code was as correct as possible. I learned that iterative programming is very helpful and helps the programmer to avoid making a mistake that would only snowball and cause much larger errors in the code later on. I think I learned what I was supposed to for this lab. It was very nice working by myself, because it meant that I could solve the problem and write the code in any way that I wanted, and did not have to worry about balancing the concerns of another person. I tend to think about problems much different than a lot of other people.
